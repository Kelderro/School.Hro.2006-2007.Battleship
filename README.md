## History
BattleShip is created as a school project by [Rob op den Kelder](https://github.com/Kelderro/) and [Stephan Klop](https://github.com/Klopperz) while in class / group: INF3J. The project has not been touched since the last day of the school project 10th of October 2006. In 2022 the project has been migrated to GitHub. After the move the project has been upgraded to be more inline with the up-to-date standards. The project will stay work in progress for a while as there are many improvement points to be made. Please do not consider this project as ready for production state.
